### Writeup / README


### Kinematic Analysis

The Kuka-arm used in this project is a SCARA serial manipulator consisting of 6 revolute joints.


### Forward Kinematics
The following orgins locations and axes orientations were used for the project.

The DH parameter table was populated based on the image above. The actual measurements were taken from the serial manipulator's URDF file.

Links | alpha(i-1) | a(i-1) | d(i-1) | theta(i)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0->1 | 0 | 0 | 0.75 | q1
1->2 | - pi/2 | 0.35 | 0 | -pi/2 + q2
2->3 | 0 | 1.25 | 0 | q3
3->4 |  - pi/2 | -0.054 | 1.5 | q4
4->5 | pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q5
5->6 | - pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q6
6->7 | 0 | 0 | 0.303 | 0

A Transformation Maxtrix symbolic form was then made using the variables from the DH paramter table.

         TF_Matrix ([[cos(q), -sin(q), 0, a],
                   [sin(q) * cos(alpha), cos(q) * cos(alpha), -sin(alpha), -sin(alpha) * d],
                   [sin(q) * sin(alpha), cos(q) * sin(alpha), cos(alpha), cos(alpha) * d],
                   [0, 0, 0, 1]])
                   
Indivitual transformation matricies for each joint-to-joint transformation were generated by subsituting the relavent values from the DH parameter table.

    T0_1 = TF_Matrix(a0,alpha0,d1,q1).subs(dh_params)
    T1_2 = TF_Matrix(a1,alpha1,d2,q2).subs(dh_params)
    T2_3 = TF_Matrix(a2,alpha2,d3,q3).subs(dh_params)
    T3_4 = TF_Matrix(a3,alpha3,d4,q4).subs(dh_params)
    T4_5 = TF_Matrix(a4,alpha4,d5,q5).subs(dh_params)
    T5_6 = TF_Matrix(a5,alpha5,d6,q6).subs(dh_params)
    T6_7 = TF_Matrix(a6,alpha6,d7,q7).subs(dh_params)

To get the total transformation from T0 to the gripper joint (T7) the following equation was used.

   T0_7 =  T0_1 * T1_2 * T2_3 * T3_4 * T4_5 * T5_6 * T6_7

### Reverse Kinematics
And here's where you can draw out and show your math for the derivation of your theta angles.

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Fill in the `IK_server.py` file with properly commented python code for calculating Inverse Kinematics based on previously performed Kinematic Analysis. Your code must guide the robot to successfully complete 8/10 pick and place cycles. Briefly discuss the code you implemented and your results. 


Here I'll talk about the code, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
